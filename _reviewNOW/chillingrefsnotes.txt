Started 20 January 2025

On 20 Jan 2025, I went through every folder in _ReviewNow and printed out bits of articles I thought I should read (or a few full articles). So next, I should (in either order:
(*) Take quick notes on the non-printed out articles 
(*) Read and take notes on the articles I printed out.

<> Not a super useful study for me for now. <>
- Weighs peach buds (Tabuenca method they call it) looking for chill and heat units. Seem to use a Q10 equation for this and just compared different Q10 values and looked for goodness of fit. 

"Then we may think that the bad precision of optimum quantity determination from a choice of about 95 "chill actions" (table 2) can be explained owing to the fact that the heat requirements are partly satisfied before the complete satisfaction of chilling requirements as B r o w n (1960) showed. Consequently we must think that the mean quantity of "heat actions" associated to the optimum quantity is a valuation both of the heat requirements and of a part of chilling requirements."

I think this is just cited in Chuine et al. 2016 for showing how to do this in apricot.

Good overview of different CU needed for some crops. Excellent citation to say it can vary a lot across species, cultivars etc.

I did not read closely. 

** Jones et al. 2013 **

This paper is in OSPREE.
They try a gazillion experiments on Ribes then look for what fits best statistically, though they say: 

"Existing models for chill accumulation have largely been derived from statistical correlation; here we report the derivation of improved models for blackcurrant using controlled environment treatments."

But if you read the rest of the abstract I think it just gets too complex, no clear model emerges from the experiments alone... 

"The impact of different combinations of temper- ature and chilling periods were described in terms of their overall ‘Effectiveness’ (E). Clear genotypic differences were found, with excessive chilling often inhibiting bud break. There was a significant interaction between observed chilling response and the period of low temperature exposure. A number of chilling models to explain observed interactions between chilling temperature and time of exposure on bud break were compared; the most effective involved an optimal response to increasing chill accumulation."

Chuine et al. 2016 cites this paper (a lot) including: 

"However, none of them were able to evaluate the efficiency of the models to predict accu- rately endodormancy break dates using observed endodormancy break dates so far (Jones et al., 2013)."

Good stuff in this paper though, so will print out intro ....

"Evidence on the chilling requirement of different fruit spe- cies or cultivars can be obtained either through statistical analysis of correlations between flowering behaviour and sea- sonal temperatures in the field, or by using controlled envi- ronment studies involving exposure of plants or cuttings to controlled temperatures and using the resulting data to derive a chill model. Unfortunately, it has been shown that field data simply do not contain sufficient information for param- eterisation of the different processes involved in the necessary ecophysiological models (e.g. Hunter & Lechowicz 1992; Ha ̈nninen et al. 2007), therefore the present study emphasises the experimental approach."
