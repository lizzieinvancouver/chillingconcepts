Started 20 January 2025

On 20 Jan 2025, I went through every folder in _ReviewNow and printed out bits of articles I thought I should read (or a few full articles). So next, I should (in either order):
(*) Take quick notes on the non-printed out articles 
(*) Read and take notes on the articles I printed out. * see START HERE below ...

*!* Point to make in our paper?

** Basler 2016 **
Evaluating phenological models for the prediction of leaf-out dates in six temperate tree species across central Europe

- This seems a very useful paper for us!
- Evaluates 35 or 37 (discussion vs. Fig caption #s) different process models for 6 tree species and finds they converge on prediction error 
- Also shows bias variance trade-off ("The transfer of site-specific parameters to other sites was associated with an almost doubling of the average prediction error, independent of distance and climatic similarity between the calibration and validation sites.")
- Very handy article about issues with these models
- Suggests simple models perform as well as more complex models
- Shows overfitting in some models. 
- Intro has review of models (from European tree perspective)
- Cites Migliavacca et al., 2012, which probably has some good stuff on land models and phenology
- Cites Battey, N.H., 2000. Aspects of seasonality. J. Exp. Bot. 51 (352), 1769–1780. For "the actual chilling requirements and effective ranges of chilling temperatures are yet scarcely known for forest tree species" (I downloaded this article into articles/ but am not sure it's worth reading ... it goes back to Bede! And is long, seems a mix of science and social sincere. ... but I also printed it, seems good article to say "what is known about it is conditioned by what particular scientists have said about it" though, umm, isn't that true of everything?)
- Photoperiod section! "Models that included photoperiod during the ecodormancy release phase were generally among the models with the best performance in all 6 species." I wonder what those models were ... could ask Victor to check. 
- Cites me for something I never want to be cited for! Saying you can't combine experiments and observations ... but also I guess this Basler paper is a good citation for belief that experiments and observations cannot be fit together. 
- Also, "Hänninen’s (1995) conclusions, based on a comparison of leaf
unfolding dates in field and in warming experiments, that to predict
phenology in a future climate, the use of complementary data from
experiments should be considered to increase data coverage for the
calibration of the model parameters."
- Actually the whole discussion section 4.1.5 is an example of why this guy should learn hierarchical models! *!* Point to make in our paper?

<> Not a super useful study for me for now. <>
- Weighs peach buds (Tabuenca method they call it) looking for chill and heat units. Seem to use a Q10 equation for this and just compared different Q10 values and looked for goodness of fit. 

"Then we may think that the bad precision of optimum quantity determination from a choice of about 95 "chill actions" (table 2) can be explained owing to the fact that the heat requirements are partly satisfied before the complete satisfaction of chilling requirements as B r o w n (1960) showed. Consequently we must think that the mean quantity of "heat actions" associated to the optimum quantity is a valuation both of the heat requirements and of a part of chilling requirements."

I think this is just cited in Chuine et al. 2016 for showing how to do this in apricot. 

** Hauagge_&_Crimmins_2000 **

Good overview of different CU needed for some crops. Excellent citation to say it can vary a lot across species, cultivars etc.

I did not read closely. 

** Jones et al. 2013 **

This paper is in OSPREE.
They try a gazillion experiments on Ribes then look for what fits best statistically, though they say: 

"Existing models for chill accumulation have largely been derived from statistical correlation; here we report the derivation of improved models for blackcurrant using controlled environment treatments."

But if you read the rest of the abstract I think it just gets too complex, no clear model emerges from the experiments alone... 

"The impact of different combinations of temper- ature and chilling periods were described in terms of their overall ‘Effectiveness’ (E). Clear genotypic differences were found, with excessive chilling often inhibiting bud break. There was a significant interaction between observed chilling response and the period of low temperature exposure. A number of chilling models to explain observed interactions between chilling temperature and time of exposure on bud break were compared; the most effective involved an optimal response to increasing chill accumulation."

Chuine et al. 2016 cites this paper (a lot) including: 

"However, none of them were able to evaluate the efficiency of the models to predict accu- rately endodormancy break dates using observed endodormancy break dates so far (Jones et al., 2013)."

Good stuff in this paper though, so will print out intro ....

"Evidence on the chilling requirement of different fruit spe- cies or cultivars can be obtained either through statistical analysis of correlations between flowering behaviour and sea- sonal temperatures in the field, or by using controlled envi- ronment studies involving exposure of plants or cuttings to controlled temperatures and using the resulting data to derive a chill model. Unfortunately, it has been shown that field data simply do not contain sufficient information for param- eterisation of the different processes involved in the necessary ecophysiological models (e.g. Hunter & Lechowicz 1992; Ha ̈nninen et al. 2007), therefore the present study emphasises the experimental approach."
