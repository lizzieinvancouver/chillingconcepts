Started 20 January 2025

On 20 Jan 2025, I went through every folder in _ReviewNow and printed out bits of articles I thought I should read (or a few full articles). So next, I should (in either order):
(*) Take quick notes on the non-printed out articles 
(*) Read and take notes on the articles I printed out. * see START HERE below ...

*!* Point to make in our paper?

To do:
- Could ask Justin to read Atkinson et al. 2013 and Considine_&_Considine_2016 or skip
- Ask for Victor's help in thinking about Kovaleski and North_etal_2022 (same thing)?

Printed papers:

** Jones et al. 2013 **

Read intro 2 March 2025:
- Ribes paper focused on a ton of experiments to find a better model (they seem to be looking down on statistical fits, but then just do a ton of statistical fits to their experimental data, so go figure)
- Good citation for people saying experiments are better (but then not clearly getting much out of them)
- Good citation for classic idea of chilling (near freezing temps that release endodormancy) citing Lang 1987 and Howe et al. 1999
- Says UK is having trouble with warming and crops, and has citations
- Cites Sunley et al. 2006 and Solomon et al. 2007 for warming and crops stuff

** Atkinson et al. 2013 **

Tried to read paper 2 March 2025, but gave up at section 3 as I was so bored:
- Review of crops being limited by chilling with warming
- SO incredibly boring. 
- Just a review of the literature on crops with some extensions into other systems (though I did not get there) and seems to have no novel info. 
- Only novel bit is lots of old citations from California etc. where chilling was not met
- Suspect there are are other bits like this: 
"There is also evidence from Ribes rubrum that a proportion of the total number of floral initials abscised during dormancy was not linked to winter temperatures, but branch orientation (Palonen and Voipio, 1994)." 
... if I could keep reading but I physically cannot. 

** Malmquist et al. 2017 **

Read intro 2 March 2025:
- This is a paper testing for which Doug Fir provenances they should grow in 'Nordic conditions'
- Has a good review of Doug for research in intro. 
- Good for FINDING citations saying interior populations need less chilling and they seem to find that too -- interior ones budburst sooner


** Fernandez et al. 2020 **

Read intro 2 March 2025:
- Luedeling paper finding his method is best (of course) though Positive Utah seems equally good
- Lots of him saying his method is more physiologically realistic. (Handy review of it here: https://ccag-eh.ucanr.edu/Chill_Portions_and_the_Dynamic_Model/) 
- Though I highlighted some bits that really sound like mathematical interaction model informing the biology  *!* 
- I started wondering if the problem of these chill models has corollary with SDMs -- based on current data, so always a bit pessimistic  *!* 
- Nice review in intro of lots of chill models 
- Lots of citations that the models do not transfer (bias variance issue, again)


** Considine_&_Considine_2016 **

Read through pg 3192 2 March 2025 and skimmed PDF in a semi-random way. 
- This article really seemed more useless than I expected. 
- Maybe good for linking dormancy in seeds and trees as cites Lang and Baskin?
- I think there is some good stuff in here (see photoperiod stuff that I highlighted) but it is very boring. 
- Good for definition dormancy, quiescence, competence 


** Lundell_etal_2019 ** 

Read intro 2 March 2025:
- Says a ton of times in intro that markers are not yet available so we must do hypo-deductive
- Goes back to Vegis (1964) and dormant seeds to propose ANOTHER models (see Fig 1) 
- We should probably cite and include this model *!* 


** North_etal_2022 **

Read intro 2 March 2025:
- Uses Kovaleski model to say their description should inform dormancy transitions
- Do a great job of saying dormancy is not well observed and semi-made up; see highlighting ("they rely on arbitrary assumptions to delineate the dormancy stage")
- "Most importantly, deacclimation potential quantifies
a physiological bud phenotype that precedes externally visible bud
growth, the necessary observation in bud forcing assays. In addition,
deacclimation potential characterizes a chill range where physiological
bud responses continuously increase until they reach their maximum
potential. This provides an opportunity to identify the most effective
temperatures contributing to the dormancy transition, thereby improv-
ing chill models."
- Need to figure this out ... maybe Victor could for the paper (do this and Kovaleski paper)

Starting on 24Dec2024 folder (be sure to skip articles above, which I had printed out):

** Basler 2016 **
Evaluating phenological models for the prediction of leaf-out dates in six temperate tree species across central Europe

- This seems a very useful paper for us!
- Evaluates 35 or 37 (discussion vs. Fig caption #s) different process models for 6 tree species and finds they converge on prediction error 
- Also shows bias variance trade-off ("The transfer of site-specific parameters to other sites was associated with an almost doubling of the average prediction error, independent of distance and climatic similarity between the calibration and validation sites.")
- Very handy article about issues with these models
- Suggests simple models perform as well as more complex models
- Shows overfitting in some models. 
- Intro has review of models (from European tree perspective)
- Cites Migliavacca et al., 2012, which probably has some good stuff on land models and phenology
- Cites Battey, N.H., 2000. Aspects of seasonality. J. Exp. Bot. 51 (352), 1769–1780. For "the actual chilling requirements and effective ranges of chilling temperatures are yet scarcely known for forest tree species" (I downloaded this article into articles/ but am not sure it's worth reading ... it goes back to Bede! And is long, seems a mix of science and social sincere. ... but I also printed it, seems good article to say "what is known about it is conditioned by what particular scientists have said about it" though, umm, isn't that true of everything?)
- Photoperiod section! "Models that included photoperiod during the ecodormancy release phase were generally among the models with the best performance in all 6 species." I wonder what those models were ... could ask Victor to check. 
- Cites me for something I never want to be cited for! Saying you can't combine experiments and observations ... but also I guess this Basler paper is a good citation for belief that experiments and observations cannot be fit together. 
- Also, "Hänninen’s (1995) conclusions, based on a comparison of leaf
unfolding dates in field and in warming experiments, that to predict
phenology in a future climate, the use of complementary data from
experiments should be considered to increase data coverage for the
calibration of the model parameters."
- Actually the whole discussion section 4.1.5 is an example of why this guy should learn hierarchical models! *!* Point to make in our paper?


** Campbell_&_Sugano_1979_COPY **

- Studied 23 populations of Doug fir in 12 growth chamber combos!
- Nice citation for the idea that these reaction norms should vary with populations (climate) which seems to have been semi-dropped
- Q_10 model
- Start of discussion: all populations had similar reactions to chilling and forcing temp, so an average makes sense
- Distance to coast matters

** Chouard 1960 **

- Long paper on vernalization vs. dormancy that I did not read fully
- Goes through lots of evidence across species
- Says breaking dormancy is not the same as vernalization; you can break dormancy without achieving vernalization (gives a seed example!)
- Vernalization is not the same as internode elongation


** Kaduk_&_Los_2007 **

- Pretty sure I pulled this paper as an example of what you should not do ... *!*
- Estimate chilling ('at the biome') level using green-up dates and crazy model fits. 
- Discussion says they found no local adaptation (whoa, cites Chuine and Kramer as finding the same)
- Good example of why we need machine learning, I mean if all you care about is prediction like here, then just do ML


** Wang_etal_2022 **

- "Here, we aimed to answer whether chilling and forcing proceed in parallel or sequentially to regulate spring phenology in temperate trees."
- With long-term observational data -- oh boy!
- "we analysed the rolling partial corre- lations between leaf unfolding dates and chilling and forcing in winter and spring using a weekly smoothing window"
- "Combining statistical with process-based approaches, we demonstrated that chilling and forcing accumulate and act in parallel to regulate spring leaf unfolding in temperate trees."
- Ask Victor to explain how this is non-identified? And/or make sure his example addresses this sort of paper?

** Atkinson et al. 2013 **

PRINTED out to read

** Legave 1982 ** 

<> Not a super useful study for me for now. <>
- Weighs peach buds (Tabuenca method they call it) looking for chill and heat units. Seem to use a Q10 equation for this and just compared different Q10 values and looked for goodness of fit. 

"Then we may think that the bad precision of optimum quantity determination from a choice of about 95 "chill actions" (table 2) can be explained owing to the fact that the heat requirements are partly satisfied before the complete satisfaction of chilling requirements as B r o w n (1960) showed. Consequently we must think that the mean quantity of "heat actions" associated to the optimum quantity is a valuation both of the heat requirements and of a part of chilling requirements."

I think this is just cited in Chuine et al. 2016 for showing how to do this in apricot. 

** Hauagge_&_Crimmins_2000 **

Good overview of different CU needed for some crops. Excellent citation to say it can vary a lot across species, cultivars etc.

I did not read closely. 

** Jones et al. 2013 **

This paper is in OSPREE.
They try a gazillion experiments on Ribes then look for what fits best statistically, though they say: 

"Existing models for chill accumulation have largely been derived from statistical correlation; here we report the derivation of improved models for blackcurrant using controlled environment treatments."

But if you read the rest of the abstract I think it just gets too complex, no clear model emerges from the experiments alone... 

"The impact of different combinations of temper- ature and chilling periods were described in terms of their overall ‘Effectiveness’ (E). Clear genotypic differences were found, with excessive chilling often inhibiting bud break. There was a significant interaction between observed chilling response and the period of low temperature exposure. A number of chilling models to explain observed interactions between chilling temperature and time of exposure on bud break were compared; the most effective involved an optimal response to increasing chill accumulation."

Chuine et al. 2016 cites this paper (a lot) including: 

"However, none of them were able to evaluate the efficiency of the models to predict accu- rately endodormancy break dates using observed endodormancy break dates so far (Jones et al., 2013)."

Good stuff in this paper though, so will print out intro ....

"Evidence on the chilling requirement of different fruit spe- cies or cultivars can be obtained either through statistical analysis of correlations between flowering behaviour and sea- sonal temperatures in the field, or by using controlled envi- ronment studies involving exposure of plants or cuttings to controlled temperatures and using the resulting data to derive a chill model. Unfortunately, it has been shown that field data simply do not contain sufficient information for param- eterisation of the different processes involved in the necessary ecophysiological models (e.g. Hunter & Lechowicz 1992; Ha ̈nninen et al. 2007), therefore the present study emphasises the experimental approach."
