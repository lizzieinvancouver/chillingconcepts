## What I did in November 2025
1. Discussed with J Auerbach how to incorporate his comments for last section, especially part 2 (see issue 10 and notesAuerbachMisc.txt): basically he just said last section shorter (and some other stuff).
2. Also addressing Victor's concerns about falsifiability and non-identifiability: Given the re-write falsifiability is basically gone from the main text! So maybe we can keep skip adding more on this? I did change some text in the beginning to address the point that diverging models sounds GOOD for falsifiability. 
3. Gone through Justin's comments (in docs/comments/) and any lingering comments by JA and VVdM
4. Made the box into a figure caption
5. Fixed up Fig 3 some
6. Addressed another set of comments from JA

## What I did in September 2025
_Did the below before sending to co-authors in October, then was totally useless from around 10 Oct to 21 Nov while traveling_ ... which is a good reminder that I often get nothing done when traveling
* Remove Box 2
* Reduce references to box 1 by moving critical text from Box 1 into main text (Justin flag what we need to move/add and I did that)
* Re-do abstract
* Introduce different fields before: Progress through new experiments could come from experiments that bridge across molecular and phenological methods in other aspects of their design ... 
* Fix the ending (see issue 10)

## What I did in Summer 2025
It's July, let's get the party started.

1. I am working on the new draft based on the outline, which I finsihed after going through feedback on github
* Maybe need to define 'phenology' as a field or do something to contrast it with molecular folks. 

## What I did next in early 2025 
Written in January 2025, I think I finished in April (le sigh)

1. Read papers I pulled together in Dec 2024 (see also issue 9; working on refs)
2. Deal with non-identifiablity (issue 12)
3. Improve molecular section (mentioned in issue 10, but could be its own issue)
4. Eventually, make a new draft (be sure to address comments by Justin in issue 10)


### Papers to look at...
In November-December 2024, I wrote the first draft of a new paper building off my long-term thoughts on this, meetings with Auerbach and Justin's work on the molecular lit. I pulled a bunch of papers to check:

* As of 20 Jan 2025, look for my notes in reviewNOW/chillingrefsnotes (YES! Look there says Lizzie of 25 Feb 2025)
1. Review Hanninen folder (briefly)
2. Check 24Dec2024 folder, which I think may especially help with some refs (issue 9)
3. Check the other files in reviewNow folder (that I have on my computer) -- some notes, and two folders for specific citations
4. Check the citations I flagged in paper version of Chuine 2016 (most now in citedChuine2016; one (Legave) requested from HU)

Eventually move all the citations here into shared folder!
