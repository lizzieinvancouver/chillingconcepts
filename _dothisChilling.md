# To do notes on chilling concept ms
Started 4 January 2025

## What to do next (in January 2025)

1. Read papers I pulled together in Dec 2024 (see also issue 9; working on refs)
2. Deal with non-identifiablity (issue 12)
3. Improve molecular section (mentioned in issue 10, but could be its own issue)
4. Eventually, make a new draft (be sure to address comments by Justin in issue 10)


### Papers to look at...
In November-December 2024, I wrote the first draft of a new paper building off my long-term thoughts on this, meetings with Auerbach and Justin's work on the molecular lit. I pulled a bunch of papers to check:

* As of 20 Jan 2025, look for my notes in reviewNOW/chillingrefsnotes
1. Review Hanninen folder (briefly)
2. Check 24Dec2024 folder, which I think may especially help with some refs (issue 9)
3. Check the other files in reviewNow folder (that I have on my computer) -- some notes, and two folders for specific citations
4. Check the citations I flagged in paper version of Chuine 2016 (most now in citedChuine2016; one (Legave) requested from HU)

Eventually move all the citations here into shared folder!
