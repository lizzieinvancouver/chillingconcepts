 - sonsteby14: _Ribes nigrum_ / optimal bud burst at 2 degC for 6 or more weeks / Figure 3 and 5 show that temps of 0 or -5 degC tended to have the highest percentage of budbreak and also the lowest number of days to bud break compared to 5, 10, and -10 degC
 - pop2000: _Salix pulchra_ & _Betula nana_ / didn't detect any experiment involving subzero, but it's mentioned in their usage of Hanninen's chilling units model
 - man10: _Picea glauca_ / chilling of 0/10 degC night/day had the most delayed bud burst progression / mean daily temperature of 10/20 degC night/day had fewest days to burst / second-best thermal regime for budburst was 0/10 day/night with a flat increase for both temps by 3 degC every 6 days / suggests that freezing temp delayed budburst (my own assumption: ecodormancy mechanism?)
 - lamb37 (technically its 1948?): _Rubus idaeus_ 'Latham' / dormant canes held at 3 degC took around half as long to burst compared to those held at -3 degC across the duration of the experiment, suggesting that the chill requirement is twice as fast when held at the optimal temperature / canes exposed to alternating 3/-3 degC 16/8 hr thermoperiod took the longest to burst, which supports the idea of prolonged chilling below a certain temperature to accumulate something (maybe it's like that model with the intermediate molecule)
 - jones12: _Ribes nigrum_ cultivars / shoots chilled at -5 degC had higher percentages overall of achieved bud stages (i.e. more had reached bud stage 1) compared to those chilled at 5 degC after exposure to 20 degC permissive temperature / in general, plants exposed to -5 degC chilling had the highest percentages of plants that had achieved a certain bud stage
 - heide15: _Ribes nigrum_ / plants were just chilled at -1 degC for 10 weeks to break dormancy, no change in temperature tested
 - granhus09: _Picea abies_ / 0 degC (0.7 +- 0.7 degC) was the chilling treatment after a dormancy induction treatment of either 12 or 21 degC / days to bud burst decreased with increasing chilling time / days to bud burst increased when the dormancy induction temp was higher (21 degC)
 - schnabel87: _Vitis vinifera_ / This paper tested for cold hardiness, not budburst
 - cook05: _Malus domestica_ 'Granny Smith' / Compared to chilling treatments of 1, 4, 7, or 10 degC (which, between the 4, had no significant difference in efficiency for budburst) the -1/13 degC night/day treatment displayed delayed bud growth and also prolonged dormancy / a later experiment in 2003 showed that chilling at 1 degC was much more efficient than 5, 9, or 13 degC for budburst

 - caffarra11: _Betula pubescens_ / exp3: in chilled plants a lower dormancy induction temp (10 degC vs 18 degC) both decreased time to budburst and also increased budburst % ; photoperiod during chilling (10 degC with either 8hr or 0hr) had no effect on budburst % or occurrence / exp4: constant short photoperiod led to higher % budburst and shorter budburst time during dormancy induction compared to plants in a treatment where photoperiod naturally decreased, but like exp3 photoperiod during chilling did not matter
 - boyer: _Pinus taeda_ / longer photoperiods prior to chilling delayed budburst / Time to budbreak was generally shortest at increasing chill duration and decreasing photoperiod (Table 2)
 - campbell75: _Pseudotsuga menziesii_ / the experiment that tests photoperiod changes had universal chill temp of 4 degC
 - heide03: _Betula pendula_, _Betula pubescens_, _Alnus glutinosa_ / Tested temperature during dormancy induction, not necessarily photoperiod
 - jones12: _Ribes nigrum_ cultivars / didn't manipulate photoperiod
 - li05: _Betula pendula_ / didn't change the photoperiod in the exp itself, but I found it interesting nonetheless / short day treatments initiated cold acclimation and freeze tolerance, which was faster in the northern ecotype compared to the southern ecotype / bud water content decreased when plants were chilled at 6 degC, no change at 0.5 degC, then rapidly increased 3 weeks later when plants were exposed to 18 degC / freezing tolerance increased from ~-10 degC to ~-20 after exposure to 6 degC, then increased further from ~-25 to ~30 when exposed to 0.5 degC, then rapidly dropped when plants were exposed to 18 degC measured through SLT_50, the temp at which 50% cellular solutes are lost / ABA concentration in the shoot apex increased n during short days
 - man17: I don't think they manipulated photoperiod
 - myking95: photoperiods changed during flushing, not chilling
 - nienstaedt66: photoperiods changed during flushing, not chilling
 - spiers74: photoperiods changed during flushing, not chilling / but I found it interesting that defoliation reduced the dormancy duration of vegetative buds that were exposed to constant chilling, but no acceleration of floral budburst
 - worrall67: _Picea abies_ / after 50 days of chilling at 4 degC, there was no difference in budburst between different photoperiod treatments / unchilled plants kept in a short photoperiod did not burst until they were exposed to 1 month of chilling / this paper's section on photoperiod is confusing because they claim that long photoperiod can induce budburst, but their results don't explicitly show that
