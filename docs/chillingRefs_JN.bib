	abstract = {VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE3 (VIN3) induction by vernalization is one of the earliest events in the vernalization response of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). However, the mechanism responsible for vernalization-mediated VIN3 induction is poorly understood. Here, we show that the constitutive repression of VIN3 in the absence of the cold is due to multiple repressive components, including a transposable element-derived sequence, LIKE-HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN1 and POLYCOMB REPRESSION COMPLEX2. Furthermore, the full extent of VIN3 induction by vernalization requires activating complex components, including EARLY FLOWERING7 and EARLY FLOWERING IN SHORT DAYS. In addition, we observed dynamic changes in the histone modifications present at VIN3 chromatin during the course of vernalization. Our results show that the induction of VIN3 includes dynamic changes at the level of chromatin triggered by long-term cold exposure.},

Darkness, after light preconditioning during dormancy, reduced leaf bud opening; however, light was obligatory when the shoots were preconditioned in the dark. Relatively short exposures to light were sufficient to stimulate leaf bud break. Terminal buds were less inhibited by darkness than were laterals. Flower bud break was inhibited in light after dark preconditioning. The red region of the spectrum was found to be active; the phytochorome system seems to be involved in the light reactions, as the red light effect was reversible with subsequent far-red illumination. Supplementary light, producing long-day conditions, could partly compensate for insufficient chilling. A possible sequence of reactions in the plant is suggested.},

	abstract = {Bud dormancy and its release are complex physiological phenomena in plants. The molecular mechanisms of bud dormancy in Liriodendron chinense are mainly unknown. Here, we studied bud dormancy and the related physiological and molecular phenomena in Liriodendron under long-day (LD) and short-day (SD). Bud burst was released faster under LD than under SD. Abscisic acid (ABA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione reductase (GR) activities were increased significantly under LD in Liriodendron buds. In contrast, the contents of gibberellic acid (GA3), ascorbic acid (AsA), glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activity decreased under LD but increased under SD. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were up-regulated under LD and down-regulated under SD and these changes correspondingly promoted (LD) or repressed (SD) cell division and the number and/or size of cells in the bud. Transcriptomic analysis of Liriodendron buds under different photoperiods identified 187 DEGs enriched in several pathways such as flavonoid biosynthesis and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, plant hormone and signal transduction, etc. that are associated with antioxidant enzymes, non-enzymatic antioxidants, and subsequently promote the growth of the buds. Our findings provide novel insights into regulating bud dormancy via flavonoid and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, plant hormone and signal transduction pathways, and ABA content. These physiological and biochemical traits would help detect bud dormancy in plants.},

	abstract = {Temperature is a key factor in the growth and development of all organisms1,2. Plants have to interpret temperature fluctuations, over hourly to monthly timescales, to align their growth and development with the seasons. Much is known about how plants respond to acute thermal stresses3,4, but the mechanisms that integrate long-term temperature exposure remain unknown. The slow, winter-long upregulation of VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE 3 (VIN3)5–7, a PHD protein that functions with Polycomb repressive complex 2 to epigenetically silence FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) during vernalization, is central to plants interpreting winter progression5,6,8–11. Here, by a forward genetic screen, we identify two dominant mutations of the transcription factor NTL8 that constitutively activate VIN3 expression and alter the slow VIN3 cold induction profile. In the wild type, the NTL8 protein accumulates slowly in the cold, and directly upregulates VIN3 transcription. Through combining computational simulation and experimental validation, we show that a major contributor to this slow accumulation is reduced NTL8 dilution due to slow growth at low temperatures. Temperature-dependent growth is thus exploited through protein dilution to provide the long-term thermosensory information for VIN3 upregulation. Indirect mechanisms involving temperature-dependent growth, in addition to direct thermosensing, may be widely relevant in long-term biological sensing of naturally fluctuating temperatures.},

	abstract = {Plants use seasonal temperature cues to time the transition to reproduction. In Arabidopsis thaliana, winter cold epigenetically silences the floral repressor locus FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) through POLYCOMB REPRESSIVE COMPLEX 2 (PRC2)1. This vernalization process aligns flowering with spring. A prerequisite for silencing is transcriptional downregulation of FLC, but how this occurs in the fluctuating temperature regimes of autumn is unknown2–4. Transcriptional repression correlates with decreased local levels of histone H3 trimethylation at K36 (H3K36me3) and H3 trimethylation at K4 (H3K4me3)5,6, which are deposited during FRIGIDA (FRI)-dependent activation of FLC7–10. Here we show that cold rapidly promotes the formation of FRI nuclear condensates that do not colocalize with an active FLC locus. This correlates with reduced FRI occupancy at the FLC promoter and FLC repression. Warm temperature spikes reverse this process, buffering FLC shutdown to prevent premature flowering. The accumulation of condensates in the cold is affected by specific co-transcriptional regulators and cold induction of a specific isoform of the antisense RNA COOLAIR5,11. Our work describes the dynamic partitioning of a transcriptional activator conferring plasticity in response to natural temperature fluctuations, thus enabling plants to effectively monitor seasonal progression.},

Here we demonstrate that lily VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE 3-LIKE 1 (LoVIL1) confers growth transition by mediating plasmodesmata opening via epigenetic repression of CALLOSE SYNTHASE 3 (LoCALS3). Moreover, we found that a novel transcription factor, NUCLEAR FACTOR Y, SUBUNIT A7 (LoNFYA7), is capable of recruiting the LoVIL1–Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and enhancing H3K27me3 at the LoCALS3 locus by recognizing the CCAAT cis-element (Cce) of its promoter. The LoNFYA7–LoVIL1 module serves as a key player in orchestrating the phase transition from slow to fast growth in lily bulbs. These studies also indicate that LoVIL1 is a suitable marker for the bud-growth-transition trait following dormancy release in lily cultivars.},

Accurate and transparent modelling of vegetation phenology is therefore key in understanding feedbacks between the biosphere and the climate system. Here, we present the phenor r package and modelling framework. The framework leverages measurements of vegetation phenology from four common phenology observation datasets, the PhenoCam network, the USA National Phenology Network (USA-NPN), the Pan European Phenology Project (PEP725), MODIS phenology (MCD12Q2) combined with (global) retrospective and projected climate data. We show an example analysis, using the phenor modelling framework, which quickly and easily compares 20 included spring phenology models for three plant functional types. An analysis of model skill using the root mean squared (RMSE) error shows little or no difference regardless of model structure, corroborating previous studies. We argue that addressing this issue will require novel model development combined with easy data assimilation as facilitated by our framework. In conclusion, we hope the phenor phenology modelling framework in the r language and environment for statistical computing will facilitate reproducibility and community driven phenology model development, in order to increase their overall predictive power, and leverage an ever growing number of phenology data products.},

	abstract = {Bud endodormancy is accompanied by transport channel apertures blockage through callose deposition, and its resume to growth requires evoking β-1,3-glucanases (BGs) to unchoke the conduit. To understand out its working manner, the statuses of the transport channels were evaluated and candidate BGs were identified during chilling and gibberellin acids (GA) induced dormancy release in tree peony. Calcein reflects plasmodesmata permeability, and no calcein was observed in the bud together with density aniline blue fluorescent around the stem phloem at 0 d chilling. With the increase of chilling accumulation, the contents of glucan declined and the activities of gulcanase increased gradually in buds, and the calcein reached the top of flower primordia at 21 d chilled bud. Both GA3 and GA4 feedings promoted bud sprouting and growth along with rapidly unchoking the transport channels, and GA3 was more effective. Several candidate β-1,3-glucanase genes were detected, combining transcriptional profiling and quantitative PCR analysis. PsBG1, PsBG3, PsBG6, PsBG8 and PsBG9 were inducible by chilling accumulation and presented laminarin hydrolyzing activities after prokaryotically expression, while PsBG1, PsBG3, PsBG8 and PsBG9 responded to GAs application. Subcellular localizations revealed that PsBG6 and PsBG9 were plasmodesmata residents. It was concluded that PsBG6 played a vital role in chilling accumulation response and PsBG9 was central in GAs-induced dormancy release, and they could be used as marker genes for dormancy release in tree peony. These results were of great value to understand the mechanism of dormancy regulation and as an important fundamental for forcing culture technology in tree peony.},

In the Arabidopsis photoperiodic flowering pathway, the circadian clock-regulated components, such as FLAVIN-BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F-BOX 1 and CONSTANS, both of which have light-controlled functions, are crucial to induce the day-length specific expression of the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) gene in leaves. Recent advances indicate that FT transcriptional regulation is central for integrating the information derived from other important internal and external factors, such as developmental age, amount of gibberellic acid, and the ambient temperature. In this review, we describe how these factors interactively regulate the expression of FT, the main component of florigen, in leaves.},

Molecular basis of temperature-mediated control of bud break is poorly understood. Here we identify a genetic network mediating the control of bud break in hybrid aspen. The key components of this network are transcription factor SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE-LIKE (SVL), closely related to Arabidopsis floral repressor SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE, and its downstream target TCP18, a tree homolog of a branching regulator in Arabidopsis. SVL and TCP18 are downregulated by low temperature. Genetic evidence demonstrates their role as negative regulators of bud break. SVL mediates bud break by antagonistically acting on gibberellic acid (GA) and abscisic acid (ABA) pathways, which function as positive and negative regulators of bud break, respectively. Thus, our results reveal the mechanistic basis for temperature-cued seasonal control of a key phenological event in perennial plants.},

How PRC2 molecular functions are regulated and how PRC2 is recruited to discrete chromatin regions are questions that have brought more attention in recent years. A mechanism to modulate PRC2-mediated activity is through its interaction with other protein partners or accessory proteins. Current evidence for PRC2 interactors has demonstrated the complexity of its protein network and how far we are from fully understanding the impact of these interactions on the activities of PRC2 core subunits and on the formation of new PRC2 versions.

The 10 genes encode orthologs of Arabidopsis thaliana BG\_ppap, a PD-associated glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) lipid-anchored protein, the Arabidopsis PD callose binding protein PDCB, and a birch (Betula pendula) putative lipid body (LB) protein. We found that these genes were differentially regulated by photoperiod, by chilling (5°C), and by feeding of gibberellins GA3 and GA4. GA3 feeding upregulated all LB-associated GH17s, whereas GA4 upregulated most GH17s with a GPI anchor and/or callose binding motif, but only GA4 induced true bud burst. Chilling upregulated a number of GA biosynthesis and signaling genes as well as FT, but not CENL1, while the reverse was true for both GA3 and GA4. Collectively, the results suggest a model for dormancy release in which chilling induces FT and both GPI lipid-anchored and GA3-inducible GH17s to reopen signaling conduits in the embryonic shoot. When temperatures rise, the reopened conduits enable movement of FT and CENL1 to their targets, where they drive bud burst, shoot elongation, and morphogenesis.},

	abstract = {In addition to pathways that regulate flowering in response to environmental signals such as photoperiod or cold temperatures (vernalization), flowering time is also regulated by light quality. In many species, far-red (FR) light is known to accelerate flowering. This is environmentally significant because leaves absorb more red light than FR light; thus, plants growing under a canopy experience light that is enriched in FR light. In this article, we have explored the promotion of flowering by FR-enriched light (FREL) in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Previous work has shown that the floral promoter CONSTANS (CO) plays a critical role in day-length perception and exhibits complex regulation; CO mRNA is regulated by the circadian clock and CO protein is stabilized by light and degraded in darkness. We find that plants grown under FREL contain higher levels of CO mRNA in the early part of the day than plants under white light. Furthermore, transgenic plants expressing CO under the control of a constitutive promoter accumulate higher levels of CO protein under FREL, indicating that FREL can increase CO protein levels independently of transcription. Consistent with the model that FREL promotes flowering through CO, mutants for co or gigantea, which are required for CO transcript accumulation, are relatively insensitive to FREL. Because the red:FR ratios used in these experiments are in the range of what plants would experience under a canopy, these results indicate that the regulation of CO by light quality likely plays a key role in the regulation of flowering time in natural environments.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The adaptation and survival of boreal and temperate perennials relies on the precise demarcation of the growing season. Seasonal growth and development are defined by day length and temperature signals. Under long-day conditions in spring, poplar FLOWERING LOCUS T2 (FT2) systemically induces shoot growth. In contrast, FT2 downregulation induced by autumnal short days triggers growth cessation and bud set. However, the molecular role of FT2 in local and long-range signaling is not entirely understood. In this study, the CRISPR/Cas9 editing tool was used to generate FT2 loss of function lines of hybrid poplar. Results indicate that FT2 is essential to promote shoot apex development and restrict internode elongation under conditions of long days. The application of bioactive gibberellins (GAs) to apical buds in FT2 loss of function lines was able to rescue bud set. Expression analysis of GA sensing and metabolic genes and hormone quantification revealed that FT2 boosts the 13-hydroxylation branch of the GA biosynthesis pathway in the shoot apex. Paclobutrazol treatment of WT leaves led to limited internode growth in the stem elongation zone. In mature leaves, FT2 was found to control the GA 13-hydroxylation pathway by increasing {\textless}italic{\textgreater}GA2ox1{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} and reducing {\textless}italic{\textgreater}GA3ox2{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} expression, causing reduced GA1 levels.

	abstract = {The growth of perennial plants in the temperate zone alternates with periods of dormancy that are typically initiated during bud development in autumn. In a systems biology approach to unravel the underlying molecular program of apical bud development in poplar (Populus tremula × Populus alba), combined transcript and metabolite profiling were applied to a high-resolution time course from short-day induction to complete dormancy. Metabolite and gene expression dynamics were used to reconstruct the temporal sequence of events during bud development. Importantly, bud development could be dissected into bud formation, acclimation to dehydration and cold, and dormancy. To each of these processes, specific sets of regulatory and marker genes and metabolites are associated and provide a reference frame for future functional studies. Light, ethylene, and abscisic acid signal transduction pathways consecutively control bud development by setting, modifying, or terminating these processes. Ethylene signal transduction is positioned temporally between light and abscisic acid signals and is putatively activated by transiently low hexose pools. The timing and place of cell proliferation arrest (related to dormancy) and of the accumulation of storage compounds (related to acclimation processes) were established within the bud by electron microscopy. Finally, the identification of a large set of genes commonly expressed during the growth-to-dormancy transitions in poplar apical buds, cambium, or Arabidopsis thaliana seeds suggests parallels in the underlying molecular mechanisms in different plant organs.},
