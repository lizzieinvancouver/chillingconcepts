	abstract = {VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE3 (VIN3) induction by vernalization is one of the earliest events in the vernalization response of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). However, the mechanism responsible for vernalization-mediated VIN3 induction is poorly understood. Here, we show that the constitutive repression of VIN3 in the absence of the cold is due to multiple repressive components, including a transposable element-derived sequence, LIKE-HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN1 and POLYCOMB REPRESSION COMPLEX2. Furthermore, the full extent of VIN3 induction by vernalization requires activating complex components, including EARLY FLOWERING7 and EARLY FLOWERING IN SHORT DAYS. In addition, we observed dynamic changes in the histone modifications present at VIN3 chromatin during the course of vernalization. Our results show that the induction of VIN3 includes dynamic changes at the level of chromatin triggered by long-term cold exposure.},

	abstract = {The effect of light on peach leaf and flower bud break was examined. It was found that leafless dormant shoots were light-perceptive organs. Darkness, after light preconditioning during dormancy, reduced leaf bud opening; however, light was obligatory when the shoots were preconditioned in the dark. Relatively short exposures to light were sufficient to stimulate leaf bud break. Terminal buds were less inhibited by darkness than were laterals. Flower bud break was inhibited in light after dark preconditioning. The red region of the spectrum was found to be active; the phytochorome system seems to be involved in the light reactions, as the red light effect was reversible with subsequent far-red illumination. Supplementary light, producing long-day conditions, could partly compensate for insufficient chilling. A possible sequence of reactions in the plant is suggested.},

	abstract = {Bud dormancy and its release are complex physiological phenomena in plants. The molecular mechanisms of bud dormancy in Liriodendron chinense are mainly unknown. Here, we studied bud dormancy and the related physiological and molecular phenomena in Liriodendron under long-day (LD) and short-day (SD). Bud burst was released faster under LD than under SD. Abscisic acid (ABA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione reductase (GR) activities were increased significantly under LD in Liriodendron buds. In contrast, the contents of gibberellic acid (GA3), ascorbic acid (AsA), glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activity decreased under LD but increased under SD. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were up-regulated under LD and down-regulated under SD and these changes correspondingly promoted (LD) or repressed (SD) cell division and the number and/or size of cells in the bud. Transcriptomic analysis of Liriodendron buds under different photoperiods identified 187 DEGs enriched in several pathways such as flavonoid biosynthesis and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, plant hormone and signal transduction, etc. that are associated with antioxidant enzymes, non-enzymatic antioxidants, and subsequently promote the growth of the buds. Our findings provide novel insights into regulating bud dormancy via flavonoid and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, plant hormone and signal transduction pathways, and ABA content. These physiological and biochemical traits would help detect bud dormancy in plants.},

	abstract = {Temperature is a key factor in the growth and development of all organisms1,2. Plants have to interpret temperature fluctuations, over hourly to monthly timescales, to align their growth and development with the seasons. Much is known about how plants respond to acute thermal stresses3,4, but the mechanisms that integrate long-term temperature exposure remain unknown. The slow, winter-long upregulation of VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE 3 (VIN3)5–7, a PHD protein that functions with Polycomb repressive complex 2 to epigenetically silence FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) during vernalization, is central to plants interpreting winter progression5,6,8–11. Here, by a forward genetic screen, we identify two dominant mutations of the transcription factor NTL8 that constitutively activate VIN3 expression and alter the slow VIN3 cold induction profile. In the wild type, the NTL8 protein accumulates slowly in the cold, and directly upregulates VIN3 transcription. Through combining computational simulation and experimental validation, we show that a major contributor to this slow accumulation is reduced NTL8 dilution due to slow growth at low temperatures. Temperature-dependent growth is thus exploited through protein dilution to provide the long-term thermosensory information for VIN3 upregulation. Indirect mechanisms involving temperature-dependent growth, in addition to direct thermosensing, may be widely relevant in long-term biological sensing of naturally fluctuating temperatures.},

	abstract = {Plants use seasonal temperature cues to time the transition to reproduction. In Arabidopsis thaliana, winter cold epigenetically silences the floral repressor locus FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) through POLYCOMB REPRESSIVE COMPLEX 2 (PRC2)1. This vernalization process aligns flowering with spring. A prerequisite for silencing is transcriptional downregulation of FLC, but how this occurs in the fluctuating temperature regimes of autumn is unknown2–4. Transcriptional repression correlates with decreased local levels of histone H3 trimethylation at K36 (H3K36me3) and H3 trimethylation at K4 (H3K4me3)5,6, which are deposited during FRIGIDA (FRI)-dependent activation of FLC7–10. Here we show that cold rapidly promotes the formation of FRI nuclear condensates that do not colocalize with an active FLC locus. This correlates with reduced FRI occupancy at the FLC promoter and FLC repression. Warm temperature spikes reverse this process, buffering FLC shutdown to prevent premature flowering. The accumulation of condensates in the cold is affected by specific co-transcriptional regulators and cold induction of a specific isoform of the antisense RNA COOLAIR5,11. Our work describes the dynamic partitioning of a transcriptional activator conferring plasticity in response to natural temperature fluctuations, thus enabling plants to effectively monitor seasonal progression.},

Here we demonstrate that lily VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE 3-LIKE 1 (LoVIL1) confers growth transition by mediating plasmodesmata opening via epigenetic repression of CALLOSE SYNTHASE 3 (LoCALS3). Moreover, we found that a novel transcription factor, NUCLEAR FACTOR Y, SUBUNIT A7 (LoNFYA7), is capable of recruiting the LoVIL1–Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and enhancing H3K27me3 at the LoCALS3 locus by recognizing the CCAAT cis-element (Cce) of its promoter. The LoNFYA7–LoVIL1 module serves as a key player in orchestrating the phase transition from slow to fast growth in lily bulbs. These studies also indicate that LoVIL1 is a suitable marker for the bud-growth-transition trait following dormancy release in lily cultivars.},

Accurate and transparent modelling of vegetation phenology is therefore key in understanding feedbacks between the biosphere and the climate system. Here, we present the phenor r package and modelling framework. The framework leverages measurements of vegetation phenology from four common phenology observation datasets, the PhenoCam network, the USA National Phenology Network (USA-NPN), the Pan European Phenology Project (PEP725), MODIS phenology (MCD12Q2) combined with (global) retrospective and projected climate data. We show an example analysis, using the phenor modelling framework, which quickly and easily compares 20 included spring phenology models for three plant functional types. An analysis of model skill using the root mean squared (RMSE) error shows little or no difference regardless of model structure, corroborating previous studies. We argue that addressing this issue will require novel model development combined with easy data assimilation as facilitated by our framework. In conclusion, we hope the phenor phenology modelling framework in the r language and environment for statistical computing will facilitate reproducibility and community driven phenology model development, in order to increase their overall predictive power, and leverage an ever growing number of phenology data products.},

To understand out its working manner, the statuses of the transport channels were evaluated and candidate BGs were identified during chilling and gibberellin acids (GA) induced dormancy release in tree peony. Calcein reflects plasmodesmata permeability, and no calcein was observed in the bud together with density aniline blue fluorescent around the stem phloem at 0 d chilling. With the increase of chilling accumulation, the contents of glucan declined and the activities of gulcanase increased gradually in buds, and the calcein reached the top of flower primordia at 21 d chilled bud. Both GA3 and GA4 feedings promoted bud sprouting and growth along with rapidly unchoking the transport channels, and GA3 was more effective. Several candidate β-1,3-glucanase genes were detected, combining transcriptional profiling and quantitative PCR analysis. PsBG1, PsBG3, PsBG6, PsBG8 and PsBG9 were inducible by chilling accumulation and presented laminarin hydrolyzing activities after prokaryotically expression, while PsBG1, PsBG3, PsBG8 and PsBG9 responded to GAs application. Subcellular localizations revealed that PsBG6 and PsBG9 were plasmodesmata residents. It was concluded that PsBG6 played a vital role in chilling accumulation response and PsBG9 was central in GAs-induced dormancy release, and they could be used as marker genes for dormancy release in tree peony. These results were of great value to understand the mechanism of dormancy regulation and as an important fundamental for forcing culture technology in tree peony.},

	abstract = {In boreal and temperate ecosystems, temperature signal regulates the reactivation of growth (bud break) in perennials in the spring. Molecular basis of temperature-mediated control of bud break is poorly understood. Here we identify a genetic network mediating the control of bud break in hybrid aspen. The key components of this network are transcription factor SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE-LIKE (SVL), closely related to Arabidopsis floral repressor SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE, and its downstream target TCP18, a tree homolog of a branching regulator in Arabidopsis. SVL and TCP18 are downregulated by low temperature. Genetic evidence demonstrates their role as negative regulators of bud break. SVL mediates bud break by antagonistically acting on gibberellic acid (GA) and abscisic acid (ABA) pathways, which function as positive and negative regulators of bud break, respectively. Thus, our results reveal the mechanistic basis for temperature-cued seasonal control of a key phenological event in perennial plants.},

PRC2-mediated deposition of H3K27me3 has amply been studied in Arabidopsis and, more recently, data from other plant model species has also been published, allowing for an increasing knowledge of PRC2 activities and target genes. How PRC2 molecular functions are regulated and how PRC2 is recruited to discrete chromatin regions are questions that have brought more attention in recent years. A mechanism to modulate PRC2-mediated activity is through its interaction with other protein partners or accessory proteins. Current evidence for PRC2 interactors has demonstrated the complexity of its protein network and how far we are from fully understanding the impact of these interactions on the activities of PRC2 core subunits and on the formation of new PRC2 versions. This review presents a list of PRC2 interactors, emphasizing their mechanistic action upon PRC2 functions and their effects on transcriptional regulation.},

The 10 genes encode orthologs of Arabidopsis thaliana BG\_ppap, a PD-associated glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) lipid-anchored protein, the Arabidopsis PD callose binding protein PDCB, and a birch (Betula pendula) putative lipid body (LB) protein. We found that these genes were differentially regulated by photoperiod, by chilling (5°C), and by feeding of gibberellins GA3 and GA4. GA3 feeding upregulated all LB-associated GH17s, whereas GA4 upregulated most GH17s with a GPI anchor and/or callose binding motif, but only GA4 induced true bud burst. Chilling upregulated a number of GA biosynthesis and signaling genes as well as FT, but not CENL1, while the reverse was true for both GA3 and GA4. Collectively, the results suggest a model for dormancy release in which chilling induces FT and both GPI lipid-anchored and GA3-inducible GH17s to reopen signaling conduits in the embryonic shoot. When temperatures rise, the reopened conduits enable movement of FT and CENL1 to their targets, where they drive bud burst, shoot elongation, and morphogenesis.},

	abstract = {In addition to pathways that regulate flowering in response to environmental signals such as photoperiod or cold temperatures (vernalization), flowering time is also regulated by light quality. In many species, far-red (FR) light is known to accelerate flowering. This is environmentally significant because leaves absorb more red light than FR light; thus, plants growing under a canopy experience light that is enriched in FR light. In this article, we have explored the promotion of flowering by FR-enriched light (FREL) in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Previous work has shown that the floral promoter CONSTANS (CO) plays a critical role in day-length perception and exhibits complex regulation; CO mRNA is regulated by the circadian clock and CO protein is stabilized by light and degraded in darkness. We find that plants grown under FREL contain higher levels of CO mRNA in the early part of the day than plants under white light. Furthermore, transgenic plants expressing CO under the control of a constitutive promoter accumulate higher levels of CO protein under FREL, indicating that FREL can increase CO protein levels independently of transcription. Consistent with the model that FREL promotes flowering through CO, mutants for co or gigantea, which are required for CO transcript accumulation, are relatively insensitive to FREL. Because the red:FR ratios used in these experiments are in the range of what plants would experience under a canopy, these results indicate that the regulation of CO by light quality likely plays a key role in the regulation of flowering time in natural environments.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The adaptation and survival of boreal and temperate perennials relies on the precise demarcation of the growing season. Seasonal growth and development are defined by day length and temperature signals. Under long-day conditions in spring, poplar FLOWERING LOCUS T2 (FT2) systemically induces shoot growth. In contrast, FT2 downregulation induced by autumnal short days triggers growth cessation and bud set. However, the molecular role of FT2 in local and long-range signaling is not entirely understood. In this study, the CRISPR/Cas9 editing tool was used to generate FT2 loss of function lines of hybrid poplar. Results indicate that FT2 is essential to promote shoot apex development and restrict internode elongation under conditions of long days. The application of bioactive gibberellins (GAs) to apical buds in FT2 loss of function lines was able to rescue bud set. Expression analysis of GA sensing and metabolic genes and hormone quantification revealed that FT2 boosts the 13-hydroxylation branch of the GA biosynthesis pathway in the shoot apex. Paclobutrazol treatment of WT leaves led to limited internode growth in the stem elongation zone. In mature leaves, FT2 was found to control the GA 13-hydroxylation pathway by increasing {\textless}italic{\textgreater}GA2ox1{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} and reducing {\textless}italic{\textgreater}GA3ox2{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} expression, causing reduced GA1 levels.

	abstract = {The growth of perennial plants in the temperate zone alternates with periods of dormancy that are typically initiated during bud development in autumn. In a systems biology approach to unravel the underlying molecular program of apical bud development in poplar (Populus tremula × Populus alba), combined transcript and metabolite profiling were applied to a high-resolution time course from short-day induction to complete dormancy. Metabolite and gene expression dynamics were used to reconstruct the temporal sequence of events during bud development. Importantly, bud development could be dissected into bud formation, acclimation to dehydration and cold, and dormancy. To each of these processes, specific sets of regulatory and marker genes and metabolites are associated and provide a reference frame for future functional studies. Light, ethylene, and abscisic acid signal transduction pathways consecutively control bud development by setting, modifying, or terminating these processes. Ethylene signal transduction is positioned temporally between light and abscisic acid signals and is putatively activated by transiently low hexose pools. The timing and place of cell proliferation arrest (related to dormancy) and of the accumulation of storage compounds (related to acclimation processes) were established within the bud by electron microscopy. Finally, the identification of a large set of genes commonly expressed during the growth-to-dormancy transitions in poplar apical buds, cambium, or Arabidopsis thaliana seeds suggests parallels in the underlying molecular mechanisms in different plant organs.},

Several models have been proposed for the prediction of the timing of budburst of woody plants. Most of these models have been evaluated for species other than Fagus sylvatica, and in some cases for flower buds. Six models were fitted to data on leaf unfolding of Fagus sylvatica, collected in the Netherlands over 57 years (1901-68). 3. All models require only temperature as input. For Fagus sylvatica, however, photoperiod may influence the timing of the onset of growth. Therefore, photosensitivity was incorporated in these models. This reduced the predictive power compared to models that do not incorporate photosensitivity. 4.

Within certain limits, extension of the chilling period compensated for non-optimal chilling temperature. However, while exposure to −10°C for 8 weeks caused bud dormancy release, continued chilling for another 8 weeks inhibited bud break completely. We propose that excessive chilling induces secondary bud dormancy, a principle that is well established in seeds, but has to our knowledge, not been recognized for bud dormancy before. Marked genotypic differences were found and discussed. The observed severe chilling requirements of black currants concur with the reported vulnerability of this crop to declining winter chill in the wake of the ongoing global warming. Furthermore, elevated autumn temperature was found to induce a particularly deep dormancy state that further increases the chilling need.},

	abstract = {To improve the predictability of bud burst and growth of boreal trees under varying climate, the thermal time for bud break in white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) seedlings was evaluated under a range of temperature conditions in controlled environment chambers. Thermal time requirements were calculated as the sum of growing degree days or growing degree hours above base temperatures ranging from –1 to 5 °C. The results indicated that the common modeling approach, which uses a high base temperature of 5 °C and growing degree days, may not be appropriate for future climatic conditions. Estimates of thermal time requirements using a base temperature of 5 °C varied considerably among temperature treatments and thus would reduce the predictability of bud burst under changing climate. In contrast, estimates of thermal time requirements with lower temperatures closer to 1 °C were relatively consistent among treatments. Growing degree hour models were less sensitive to base temperature than degree day models. These results should help in the selection of appropriate base temperatures and thermal time models in quantification of thermal time for bud burst modeling in other boreal trees.},

The rate of budburst, determined after forcing at 25°C, was used to follow the progression of bud dormancy. The freezing pre-treatment clearly enhanced (deepened) bud dormancy in all experiments. Clearly definable influences due to the presence of leaves during the pre-treatment were not observed on shoots cold stored at chilling temperatures. Trees were defoliated before leaf drop in late summer/autumn under field conditions by hand (2001) and using a spray containing 3\% urea and 1.8\% zinc sulphate in 2003. In 2001 the first two hand defoliation dates significantly enhanced dormancy, while in 2003 chemical defoliation had no effect. These data indicate that the leaves are not clearly involved in the perception of factors that are responsible for dormancy induction. As with dormancy release it is possible that the perception of induction factors, i.e. low temperatures, and as shown in these data, freezing temperatures, occurs within the buds themselves.},

	abstract = {In trees adapted to cold climates, conditions during autumn and winter may influence the subsequent timing of bud burst and hence tree survival during early spring frosts. We tested the effects of two temperatures during dormancy induction and mild spells (MS) during chilling on the timing of bud burst in three Picea abies (L.) Karst. provenances (58–66° N). One-year-old seedlings were induced to become dormant at temperatures of 12 or 21 °C applied during 9 weeks of short days (12-h photoperiod). The seedlings were then moved to cold storage and given either continuous chilling at 0.7 °C (control), or chilling interrupted by one 14-day MS at either 8 or 12 °C. Interruptions with MS were staggered throughout the 175-day chilling period, resulting in 10 MS differing in date of onset. Subsets of seedlings were moved to forcing conditions (12-h photoperiod, 12 °C) throughout the chilling period, to assess dormancy status at different timings of the MS treatment. Finally, after 175 days of chilling, timing of bud burst was assessed in a 24-h photoperiod at 12 °C (control and MS-treated seedlings). The MS treatment did not significantly affect days to bud burst when given early (after 7–35 chilling days). When MS was given after 49 chilling days or later, the seedlings burst bud earlier than the controls, and the difference increased with increasing length of the chilling period given before the MS. The 12 °C MS treatment was more effective than the 8 °C MS treatment, and the difference remained constant after the seedlings had received 66 or more chilling days before the MS treatment was applied. In all provenances, a constant temperature of 21 °C during dormancy induction resulted in more dormant seedlings (delayed bud burst) than a constant temperature of 12 °C, but this did not delay the response to the MS treatment.},

	abstract = {Winter chilling is critical for flowering and fruiting of many temperate fruits, with evidence that blackcurrant (Ribes nigrum L.) cropping has been adversely affected by warm winters. Accurate models of chill accumulation in blackcurrant are required so that breeding strategies can be formulated for the generation of new cultivars with resilience to future climates. Existing models for chill accumulation have largely been derived from statistical correlation; here we report the derivation of improved models for blackcurrant using controlled environment treatments. Hardwood cuttings from a diverse set of cultivars were exposed to constant or varying chilling temperatures and the effects on bud break after transfer to a warm, permissive environment evaluated. The impact of different combinations of temperature and chilling periods were described in terms of their overall ‘Effectiveness’ (E). Clear genotypic differences were found, with excessive chilling often inhibiting bud break. There was a significant interaction between observed chilling response and the period of low temperature exposure. A number of chilling models to explain observed interactions between chilling temperature and time of exposure on bud break were compared; the most effective involved an optimal response to increasing chill accumulation. The effects of varying temperatures during chilling on bud break were complex, with warm temperature breaks substantially inhibiting bud development and cooler temperature breaks tending to enhance bud burst. The relevance of these models to generic studies of endodormancy is discussed, together with their potential application to the development of phenotyping screens for future breeding using diverse blackcurrant germplasm.},

	abstract = {The onset of the growing season of trees has been earlier by 2.3 days per decade during the last 40 years in temperate Europe because of global warming. The effect of temperature on plant phenology is, however, not linear because temperature has a dual effect on bud development. On one hand, low temperatures are necessary to break bud endodormancy, and, on the other hand, higher temperatures are necessary to promote bud cell growth afterward. Different process-based models have been developed in the last decades to predict the date of budbreak of woody species. They predict that global warming should delay or compromise endodormancy break at the species equatorward range limits leading to a delay or even impossibility to flower or set new leaves. These models are classically parameterized with flowering or budbreak dates only, with no information on the endodormancy break date because this information is very scarce. Here, we evaluated the efficiency of a set of phenological models to accurately predict the endodormancy break dates of three fruit trees. Our results show that models calibrated solely with budbreak dates usually do not accurately predict the endodormancy break date. Providing endodormancy break date for the model parameterization results in much more accurate prediction of this latter, with, however, a higher error than that on budbreak dates. Most importantly, we show that models not calibrated with endodormancy break dates can generate large discrepancies in forecasted budbreak dates when using climate scenarios as compared to models calibrated with endodormancy break dates. This discrepancy increases with mean annual temperature and is therefore the strongest after 2050 in the southernmost regions. Our results claim for the urgent need of massive measurements of endodormancy break dates in forest and fruit trees to yield more robust projections of phenological changes in a near future.},

We show, in hybrid aspen trees, that photoperiodic regulation of dormancy is mechanistically distinct from autumnal growth cessation. Dormancy sets in when symplastic intercellular communication through plasmodesmata is blocked by a process dependent on the phytohormone abscisic acid. The communication blockage prevents growth-promoting signals from accessing the meristem. Thus, precocious growth is disallowed during dormancy. The dormant period, which supports robust survival of the aspen tree in winter, is due to loss of access to growth-promoting signals.},

Exposure to the prolonged cold of winter, through a process called vernalization, is required to alleviate this block and permit flowering in the second growing season1. In winter-annual types of Arabidopsis thaliana, a flowering repressor, FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), is expressed at levels that inhibit flowering in the first growing season2. Vernalization promotes flowering by causing a repression of FLC that is mitotically stable after return to warm growing conditions2. Here we identify a gene with a function in the measurement of the duration of cold exposure and in the establishment of the vernalized state. We show that this silencing involves changes in the modification of histones in FLC chromatin.},
