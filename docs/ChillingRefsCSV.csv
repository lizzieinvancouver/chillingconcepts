Furthermore, the full extent of VIN3 induction by vernalization requires activating complex components, including EARLY FLOWERING7 and EARLY FLOWERING IN SHORT DAYS. In addition, we observed dynamic changes in the histone modifications present at VIN3 chromatin during the course of vernalization. Our results show that the induction of VIN3 includes dynamic changes at the level of chromatin triggered by long-term cold exposure.","2010-10-01","2024-07-22 18:28:55","2024-07-22 18:28:55","2024-07-22 18:28:54","949-957","","2","154","","Plant Physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","C:\Users\sapph\Zotero\storage\EG6S28BT\Kim et al. - 2010 - Vernalization-Mediated VIN3 Induction Overcomes th.pdf; C:\Users\sapph\Zotero\storage\94DJE72B\6111466.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Relatively short exposures to light were sufficient to stimulate leaf bud break. Terminal buds were less inhibited by darkness than were laterals. Flower bud break was inhibited in light after dark preconditioning. The red region of the spectrum was found to be active; the phytochorome system seems to be involved in the light reactions, as the red light effect was reversible with subsequent far-red illumination.

The molecular mechanisms of bud dormancy in Liriodendron chinense are mainly unknown. Here, we studied bud dormancy and the related physiological and molecular phenomena in Liriodendron under long-day (LD) and short-day (SD). Bud burst was released faster under LD than under SD. Abscisic acid (ABA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione reductase (GR) activities were increased significantly under LD in Liriodendron buds. In contrast, the contents of gibberellic acid (GA3), ascorbic acid (AsA), glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activity decreased under LD but increased under SD. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were up-regulated under LD and down-regulated under SD and these changes correspondingly promoted (LD) or repressed (SD) cell division and the number and/or size of cells in the bud. Transcriptomic analysis of Liriodendron buds under different photoperiods identified 187 DEGs enriched in several pathways such as flavonoid biosynthesis and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, plant hormone and signal transduction, etc. that are associated with antioxidant enzymes, non-enzymatic antioxidants, and subsequently promote the growth of the buds.

Plants have to interpret temperature fluctuations, over hourly to monthly timescales, to align their growth and development with the seasons. Much is known about how plants respond to acute thermal stresses3,4, but the mechanisms that integrate long-term temperature exposure remain unknown. The slow, winter-long upregulation of VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE 3 (VIN3)5–7, a PHD protein that functions with Polycomb repressive complex 2 to epigenetically silence FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) during vernalization, is central to plants interpreting winter progression5,6,8–11. Here, by a forward genetic screen, we identify two dominant mutations of the transcription factor NTL8 that constitutively activate VIN3 expression and alter the slow VIN3 cold induction profile. In the wild type, the NTL8 protein accumulates slowly in the cold, and directly upregulates VIN3 transcription. Through combining computational simulation and experimental validation, we show that a major contributor to this slow accumulation is reduced NTL8 dilution due to slow growth at low temperatures. Temperature-dependent growth is thus exploited through protein dilution to provide the long-term thermosensory information for VIN3 upregulation. Indirect mechanisms involving temperature-dependent growth, in addition to direct thermosensing, may be widely relevant in long-term biological sensing of naturally fluctuating temperatures.","2020-07","2024-07-22 18:33:53","2024-07-22 18:33:53","2024-07-22 18:33:53","825-829","","7818","583","","","","","","","","","","en","2020 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","C:\Users\sapph\Zotero\storage\UWASZDNQ\Zhao et al. - 2020 - Temperature-dependent growth contributes to long-t.pdf","","","Computational models; Plant molecular biology; Plant physiology; Plant signalling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Arabidopsis thaliana, winter cold epigenetically silences the floral repressor locus FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) through POLYCOMB REPRESSIVE COMPLEX 2 (PRC2)1. This vernalization process aligns flowering with spring. A prerequisite for silencing is transcriptional downregulation of FLC, but how this occurs in the fluctuating temperature regimes of autumn is unknown2–4. Transcriptional repression correlates with decreased local levels of histone H3 trimethylation at K36 (H3K36me3) and H3 trimethylation at K4 (H3K4me3)5,6, which are deposited during FRIGIDA (FRI)-dependent activation of FLC7–10. Here we show that cold rapidly promotes the formation of FRI nuclear condensates that do not colocalize with an active FLC locus. This correlates with reduced FRI occupancy at the FLC promoter and FLC repression. Warm temperature spikes reverse this process, buffering FLC shutdown to prevent premature flowering. The accumulation of condensates in the cold is affected by specific co-transcriptional regulators and cold induction of a specific isoform of the antisense RNA COOLAIR5,11. Our work describes the dynamic partitioning of a transcriptional activator conferring plasticity in response to natural temperature fluctuations, thus enabling plants to effectively monitor seasonal progression.","2021-11","2024-07-22 18:34:15","2024-07-22 18:34:15","2024-07-22 18:34:15","657-661","","7886","599","","","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","C:\Users\sapph\Zotero\storage\E6R6VSAP\Zhu et al. - 2021 - Cold-induced Arabidopsis FRIGIDA nuclear condensat.pdf","","","Plant molecular biology; Abiotic; Gene silencing; Long non-coding RNAs; Nuclear speckles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moreover, we found that a novel transcription factor, NUCLEAR FACTOR Y, SUBUNIT A7 (LoNFYA7), is capable of recruiting the LoVIL1–Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and enhancing H3K27me3 at the LoCALS3 locus by recognizing the CCAAT cis-element (Cce) of its promoter.

Accurate and transparent modelling of vegetation phenology is therefore key in understanding feedbacks between the biosphere and the climate system. Here, we present the phenor r package and modelling framework. The framework leverages measurements of vegetation phenology from four common phenology observation datasets, the PhenoCam network, the USA National Phenology Network (USA-NPN), the Pan European Phenology Project (PEP725), MODIS phenology (MCD12Q2) combined with (global) retrospective and projected climate data.

An analysis of model skill using the root mean squared (RMSE) error shows little or no difference regardless of model structure, corroborating previous studies. We argue that addressing this issue will require novel model development combined with easy data assimilation as facilitated by our framework.

To understand out its working manner, the statuses of the transport channels were evaluated and candidate BGs were identified during chilling and gibberellin acids (GA) induced dormancy release in tree peony. Calcein reflects plasmodesmata permeability, and no calcein was observed in the bud together with density aniline blue fluorescent around the stem phloem at 0 d chilling. With the increase of chilling accumulation, the contents of glucan declined and the activities of gulcanase increased gradually in buds, and the calcein reached the top of flower primordia at 21 d chilled bud. Both GA3 and GA4 feedings promoted bud sprouting and growth along with rapidly unchoking the transport channels, and GA3 was more effective. Several candidate β-1,3-glucanase genes were detected, combining transcriptional profiling and quantitative PCR analysis. PsBG1, PsBG3, PsBG6, PsBG8 and PsBG9 were inducible by chilling accumulation and presented laminarin hydrolyzing activities after prokaryotically expression, while PsBG1, PsBG3, PsBG8 and PsBG9 responded to GAs application. Subcellular localizations revealed that PsBG6 and PsBG9 were plasmodesmata residents. It was concluded that PsBG6 played a vital role in chilling accumulation response and PsBG9 was central in GAs-induced dormancy release, and they could be used as marker genes for dormancy release in tree peony. These results were of great value to understand the mechanism of dormancy regulation and as an important fundamental for forcing culture technology in tree peony.","2021-10-01","2024-07-22 18:40:51","2024-07-22 18:40:51","2024-07-22 18:40:51","771-784","","","167","","Plant Physiology and Biochemistry","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\sapph\Zotero\storage\QBD5ILCA\S0981942821004666.html","","","Chilling; Dormancy; Gibberellin acids; Transport channel; β-1,3-Glucanases","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In many species, far-red (FR) light is known to accelerate flowering. This is environmentally significant because leaves absorb more red light than FR light; thus, plants growing under a canopy experience light that is enriched in FR light. In this article, we have explored the promotion of flowering by FR-enriched light (FREL) in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Previous work has shown that the floral promoter CONSTANS (CO) plays a critical role in day-length perception and exhibits complex regulation; CO mRNA is regulated by the circadian clock and CO protein is stabilized by light and degraded in darkness. We find that plants grown under FREL contain higher levels of CO mRNA in the early part of the day than plants under white light. Furthermore, transgenic plants expressing CO under the control of a constitutive promoter accumulate higher levels of CO protein under FREL, indicating that FREL can increase CO protein levels independently of transcription. Consistent with the model that FREL promotes flowering through CO, mutants for co or gigantea, which are required for CO transcript accumulation, are relatively insensitive to FREL. Because the red:FR ratios used in these experiments are in the range of what plants would experience under a canopy, these results indicate that the regulation of CO by light quality likely plays a key role in the regulation of flowering time in natural environments.","2008-09-01","2024-07-22 18:45:43","2024-07-22 18:45:43","2024-07-22 18:45:43","269-279","","1","148","","Plant Physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","C:\Users\sapph\Zotero\storage\PC6K55XC\Kim et al. - 2008 - Regulation of CONSTANS and FLOWERING LOCUS T Expre.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Metabolite and gene expression dynamics were used to reconstruct the temporal sequence of events during bud development. Importantly, bud development could be dissected into bud formation, acclimation to dehydration and cold, and dormancy. To each of these processes, specific sets of regulatory and marker genes and metabolites are associated and provide a reference frame for future functional studies. Light, ethylene, and abscisic acid signal transduction pathways consecutively control bud development by setting, modifying, or terminating these processes. Ethylene signal transduction is positioned temporally between light and abscisic acid signals and is putatively activated by transiently low hexose pools. The timing and place of cell proliferation arrest (related to dormancy) and of the accumulation of storage compounds (related to acclimation processes) were established within the bud by electron microscopy.

Several models have been proposed for the prediction of the timing of budburst of woody plants. Most of these models have been evaluated for species other than Fagus sylvatica, and in some cases for flower buds. Six models were fitted to data on leaf unfolding of Fagus sylvatica, collected in the Netherlands over 57 years (1901-68). 3. All models require only temperature as input. For Fagus sylvatica, however, photoperiod may influence the timing of the onset of growth. Therefore, photosensitivity was incorporated in these models. This reduced the predictive power compared to models that do not incorporate photosensitivity. 4.

While single node cuttings underestimated the chilling requirements of intact plants, severed shoots and intact plants produced similar results. Chilling at −5°C for 14 weeks or more were optimal for breaking of bud dormancy and promotion of flower development in most cultivars, flower development usually having greater chilling needs than bud break itself. Within certain limits, extension of the chilling period compensated for non-optimal chilling temperature. However, while exposure to −10°C for 8 weeks caused bud dormancy release, continued chilling for another 8 weeks inhibited bud break completely. We propose that excessive chilling induces secondary bud dormancy, a principle that is well established in seeds, but has to our knowledge, not been recognized for bud dormancy before. Marked genotypic differences were found and discussed. The observed severe chilling requirements of black currants concur with the reported vulnerability of this crop to declining winter chill in the wake of the ongoing global warming.

The rate of budburst, determined after forcing at 25°C, was used to follow the progression of bud dormancy. The freezing pre-treatment clearly enhanced (deepened) bud dormancy in all experiments. Clearly definable influences due to the presence of leaves during the pre-treatment were not observed on shoots cold stored at chilling temperatures. Trees were defoliated before leaf drop in late summer/autumn under field conditions by hand (2001) and using a spray containing 3% urea and 1.8% zinc sulphate in 2003. In 2001 the first two hand defoliation dates significantly enhanced dormancy, while in 2003 chemical defoliation had no effect. These data indicate that the leaves are not clearly involved in the perception of factors that are responsible for dormancy induction. As with dormancy release it is possible that the perception of induction factors, i.e. low temperatures, and as shown in these data, freezing temperatures, occurs within the buds themselves.","2005-09-01","2024-08-27 21:35:35","2024-08-27 21:35:35","2024-08-27 21:35:35","170-176","","2","106","","Scientia Horticulturae","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\sapph\Zotero\storage\TZ32M4ZF\S0304423805001214.html","","","Temperature; × Borkh; Apple bud dormancy; Defoliation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Accurate models of chill accumulation in blackcurrant are required so that breeding strategies can be formulated for the generation of new cultivars with resilience to future climates. Existing models for chill accumulation have largely been derived from statistical correlation; here we report the derivation of improved models for blackcurrant using controlled environment treatments. Hardwood cuttings from a diverse set of cultivars were exposed to constant or varying chilling temperatures and the effects on bud break after transfer to a warm, permissive environment evaluated. The impact of different combinations of temperature and chilling periods were described in terms of their overall ‘Effectiveness’ (E). Clear genotypic differences were found, with excessive chilling often inhibiting bud break. There was a significant interaction between observed chilling response and the period of low temperature exposure. A number of chilling models to explain observed interactions between chilling temperature and time of exposure on bud break were compared; the most effective involved an optimal response to increasing chill accumulation. The effects of varying temperatures during chilling on bud break were complex, with warm temperature breaks substantially inhibiting bud development and cooler temperature breaks tending to enhance bud burst. The relevance of these models to generic studies of endodormancy is discussed, together with their potential application to the development of phenotyping screens for future breeding using diverse blackcurrant germplasm.","2013","2024-08-27 21:37:54","2024-08-27 21:37:54","2024-08-27 21:37:54","18-27","","s1","15","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1438-8677.2012.00590.x","","C:\Users\sapph\Zotero\storage\J785XQU4\j.1438-8677.2012.00590.html","","","dormancy; Blackcurrant; climate change; winter chilling; woody plants","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The unrevealed hurdle of endodormancy break","Global Change Biology","","1365-2486","10.1111/gcb.13383","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.13383","The onset of the growing season of trees has been earlier by 2.3 days per decade during the last 40 years in temperate Europe because of global warming. The effect of temperature on plant phenology is, however, not linear because temperature has a dual effect on bud development. On one hand, low temperatures are necessary to break bud endodormancy, and, on the other hand, higher temperatures are necessary to promote bud cell growth afterward. Different process-based models have been developed in the last decades to predict the date of budbreak of woody species. They predict that global warming should delay or compromise endodormancy break at the species equatorward range limits leading to a delay or even impossibility to flower or set new leaves. These models are classically parameterized with flowering or budbreak dates only, with no information on the endodormancy break date because this information is very scarce. Here, we evaluated the efficiency of a set of phenological models to accurately predict the endodormancy break dates of three fruit trees. Our results show that models calibrated solely with budbreak dates usually do not accurately predict the endodormancy break date. Providing endodormancy break date for the model parameterization results in much more accurate prediction of this latter, with, however, a higher error than that on budbreak dates. Most importantly, we show that models not calibrated with endodormancy break dates can generate large discrepancies in forecasted budbreak dates when using climate scenarios as compared to models calibrated with endodormancy break dates. This discrepancy increases with mean annual temperature and is therefore the strongest after 2050 in the southernmost regions. Our results claim for the urgent need of massive measurements of endodormancy break dates in forest and fruit trees to yield more robust projections of phenological changes in a near future.","2016","2024-08-27 21:38:35","2024-08-27 21:38:35","2024-08-27 21:38:35","3444-3460","","10","22","","","Can phenological models predict tree phenology accurately in the future?","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/gcb.13383","","C:\Users\sapph\Zotero\storage\BQLHUIUU\Chuine et al. - 2016 - Can phenological models predict tree phenology acc.pdf; C:\Users\sapph\Zotero\storage\MW8PB2WK\gcb.html","","","flowering; budbreak; climate change impact; endodormancy break; Juglans regia; process-based phenological models; Prunus armeniaca; Prunus persica","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We show, in hybrid aspen trees, that photoperiodic regulation of dormancy is mechanistically distinct from autumnal growth cessation. Dormancy sets in when symplastic intercellular communication through plasmodesmata is blocked by a process dependent on the phytohormone abscisic acid. The communication blockage prevents growth-promoting signals from accessing the meristem. Thus, precocious growth is disallowed during dormancy. The dormant period, which supports robust survival of the aspen tree in winter, is due to loss of access to growth-promoting signals.","2018-04-13","2024-08-27 21:40:09","2024-08-27 21:40:09","2024-08-27 21:40:09","212-215","","6385","360","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","C:\Users\sapph\Zotero\storage\2CFB94ZZ\Tylewicz et al. - 2018 - Photoperiodic control of seasonal growth is mediat.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Exposure to the prolonged cold of winter, through a process called vernalization, is required to alleviate this block and permit flowering in the second growing season1. In winter-annual types of Arabidopsis thaliana, a flowering repressor, FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), is expressed at levels that inhibit flowering in the first growing season2. Vernalization promotes flowering by causing a repression of FLC that is mitotically stable after return to warm growing conditions2. Here we identify a gene with a function in the measurement of the duration of cold exposure and in the establishment of the vernalized state. We show that this silencing involves changes in the modification of histones in FLC chromatin.","2004-01","2024-08-27 21:42:51","2024-08-27 21:42:51","2024-08-27 21:42:51","159-164","","6970","427","","","","","","","","","","en","2004 Macmillan Magazines Ltd.","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","C:\Users\sapph\Zotero\storage\JG9WYBKQ\Sung and Amasino - 2004 - Vernalization in Arabidopsis thaliana is mediated .pdf","","","Humanities and Social Sciences; multidisciplinary; Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
